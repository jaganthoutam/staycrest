# StayCrest Search Troubleshooting and Observability Improvements

## Issues Identified

1. No detailed logging of search operations
2. Lack of metrics for monitoring search performance
3. Limited diagnostic information for debugging
4. No robust error handling in search components
5. Missing health checks and status endpoints

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Logging with ELK Stack

- Created a comprehensive logging service (`logging-service.js`) that formats logs for ELK
- Added structured logging with JSON formatting
- Implemented context-based logging with component identification
- Set up child loggers for better organization and traceability
- Created Logstash pipeline for processing logs into Elasticsearch

### 2. Performance Metrics with Prometheus/Grafana

- Created a custom metrics service compatible with Prometheus format
- Added key metrics for search performance:
  - Request counts by source and status
  - Search latency with histograms
  - Error rates by source and code
  - Cache hit ratios
  - Tool usage statistics
- Added Grafana dashboards for visualizing metrics
- Set up alerts for detecting performance issues

### 3. Improved Error Handling in Search Components

- Added detailed error capturing in SearchAgent
- Implemented proper error propagation
- Created error-specific metrics
- Added diagnostics information to track errors
- Created health check endpoints to verify component status

### 4. Added Detailed Diagnostics

- Added tracing with correlation IDs for requests
- Implemented detailed logging of search parameters and results
- Added diagnostics for capturing last error and last search
- Created comprehensive status endpoints for monitoring
- Added health check endpoints with dependency verification

### 5. Better API Status/Health Endpoints

- Created `/api/health` endpoint for basic health status
- Added `/api/health/status` for detailed component status
- Implemented `/api/health/metrics` for Prometheus metrics scraping
- Added authentication for sensitive status endpoints
- Implemented custom health checks for each component

### 6. Docker-based Monitoring Stack

- Added Docker Compose configuration for ELK stack
- Set up Prometheus and Grafana containers
- Created Grafana dashboards for search performance
- Set up Elasticsearch indices for log storage
- Created Logstash pipeline for log processing

## How to Use

### Starting Monitoring Stack

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yml up -d
```

### Accessing Dashboards

- Kibana: http://localhost:5601
- Grafana: http://localhost:3001 (admin/staycrest)
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

### Checking Health Status

- Basic health: http://localhost:3000/api/health
- Detailed status: http://localhost:3000/api/health/status (admin access required)
- Metrics: http://localhost:3000/api/health/metrics

## Next Steps

1. Implement alerting for critical errors and performance issues
2. Add distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
3. Set up automated test suite for search functionality
4. Create more detailed Grafana dashboards for specific components
5. Implement log rotation and archiving strategies
6. Add resource utilization metrics for better capacity planning
